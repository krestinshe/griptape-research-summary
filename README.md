Example GripTape Research Summary and R Code

This document is meant to showcase my skills in data science, data visualization, and the written explanation of data to a non-technical audience. It includes the content pages from an example Research Summary that I made for the GripTape project in the Purpose and Identity Processes Lab at Cornell. This example is made using mock data. Over the course of the semester, I created many of these research summaries containing visualizations and explanations of the psychological data of high-schooler participants in the GripTape program. An example of the R code I used to produce the graphs in the Research Summary is included after the Example Research Summary.
